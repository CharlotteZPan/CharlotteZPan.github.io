## Welcome to my page!

Hi there, welcome to my page! This is Charlotte. I just started my first term this fall as an Master in Environmental Studies (MES) student at the University of Waterloo. 
My current research project focuses on the evolution of human mobility patterns through different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially how the local mobility patterns have reacted to the different lockdown policies in Ontario. Attached below is a brief intro about my project and my lab.



### Discovering the Evolution of Human Mobility Patterns through Different Phases of the COVID-19 Response in Ontario
As this topic suggests, in this project, I aim to evaluate the non-pharmaceutical interventions from the local and the provincial governments in Ontario by leveraging the power of human mobility data and deep learning models.

Several previous studies on COVID-19 response (Pepe et al. 2020 & Kang et al. 2020) have all shown that human mobility data, which measures the spatial-temporal patterns of people’s moving behaviors, is the key to measuring the impacts of non-pharmaceutical interventions during the pandemic. While dozens of mobility datasets addressing this problem have been created for China, Italy, United State and many other regions of the world (Gao et al. 2020, Zhou et al. 2020, Pepe et al. 2020 & Kang et al. 2020), there is still no such work done in Canada. And if we specifically look at the COVID-19 intervention timeline in Ontario (Figure 1), we can easily find that the past two year of pandemic is crammed of turning points representing all kind of policy changes ranging from service closure, to social distancing, to travel restrictions. At the same time, we have saw recurring anti-lockdown protests with no social distance maintained in many cities of Ontario and constantly heard voice against all the policies and especially the stay-at-home order from the local people. Knowing the gap between policy and implementation, we demand a quantitative method to better assess the real effects of those non-pharmaceutical policies to answer the questions: 

In Ontario, how effective have those lockdown policies been? Do we still need them if they have failed to reduce people’s moving activities but instead exuberated the case by urging more people to gather on the streets? How would the travelling decision of individuals make a difference to their community or the city/province overall?
